# EditsBeauty

On-device portrait and photo editor. Photos stay in the browser. Filters, crop, retouch, and save all run on the device.

**Live app:** https://stisla2021.github.io/EditsBeauty/

Version V1.0.0. Copyright (c) StISLA2021.

## Run it locally

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npx vite preview
```

The preview serves the built site. `npm run build` runs Vite and writes the site into `dist/`.

## Deploy

Pushes to `main` publish the site with GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`). The live address is https://stisla2021.github.io/EditsBeauty/

After a push, the Pages workflow must finish before the new files show up.
